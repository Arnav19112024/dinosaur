<P ALIGN="justify">Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that have lived on Earth for about 245 million years. In 1842, the English naturalist Sir Richard Owen coined the term Dinosauria, derived from the Greek deinos, meaning “fearfully great,” and sauros, meaning “lizard.” Dinosaur fossils have been found on all seven continents.</p>
<h2 align="center">TYPE OF DINOSAUR</H2>
<p ALIGN="justify">Estimates vary, but in terms of extinct non-avian dinosaurs, about 300 valid genera and roughly 700 valid species have been discovered and named. However, given that the fossil record is incomplete, in the sense that scientists have yet to discover fossils of other kinds of dinosaurs that no doubt existed, these numbers do not reflect the true diversity of extinct dinosaurs.One reason for the incompleteness of the fossil record is that rocks for some geologic time periods are not commonly found on the surface of the Earth. For example, many more kinds of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs are known than Middle Jurassic dinosaurs because outcrops of Late Cretaceous are more numerous and more widely spread geographically than those of Middle Jurassic age.</p>

The type species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin), often shortened to T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented theropods. It lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the latest Campanian-Maastrichtian ages of the Late Cretaceous period, 72.7 to 66 million years ago. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures 12.3–12.4 m (40–41 ft) in length, but according to most modern estimates, Tyrannosaurus could have exceeded sizes of 13 m (43 ft) in length, 3.7–4 m (12–13 ft) in hip height, and 8.8 tonnes (8.7 long tons; 9.7 short tons) in mass. Although some other theropods might have rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus in size, it is still among the largest known land predators, with its estimated bite force being the largest among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The question of whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in paleontology. Most paleontologists today accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger.</p>

Spinosaurus, or “spined reptile,” was named for its “sail back” feature, created by tall vertebral spines. It was named by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915 on the basis of the discovery of a partial skeleton from Bahariya Oasis in western Egypt by his assistant Richard Markgraf. These fossils were destroyed in April 1944 when British aircraft inadvertently bombed the museum in Munich in which they were housed. For several decades Spinosaurus was known only from Stromer’s monographic descriptions; however, additional fragmentary remains were discovered during the 1990s and 2000s in Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia. Related taxa in the family Spinosauridae include Baryonyx from England, Irritator from Brazil, and Suchomimus from Niger.Spinosaurus, which was longer and heavier than Tyrannosaurus, is the largest known carnivorous dinosaur. It possessed a skull 1.75 metres (roughly 6 feet) long, a body length of 14–18 metres (46–59 feet), and an estimated mass of 12,000–20,000 kg (13–22 tons).Spinosaurus, which was longer and heavier than Tyrannosaurus, is the largest known carnivorous dinosaur.

It was one of the last-known non-avian dinosaurs and lived until the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago. The name Triceratops, which means 'three-horned face', is derived from the Greek words trí- (τρί-) meaning 'three', kéras (κέρας) meaning 'horn', and ṓps (ὤψ) meaning 'face'.Bearing a large bony frill, three horns on the skull, and a large, four-legged body, exhibiting convergent evolution with bovines and rhinoceroses, Triceratops is one of the most recognizable of all dinosaurs and the best-known ceratopsian. It was also one of the largest, measuring around 8–9 metres (26–30 ft) long and weighing up to 6–10 metric tons (6.6–11.0 short tons). It shared the landscape with and was most likely preyed upon by Tyrannosaurus, though it is less certain that two adults would battle in the fanciful manner often depicted in museum displays and popular media. The functions of the frills and three distinctive facial horns on its head have inspired countless debates. Traditionally, these have been viewed as defensive weapons against predators. More recent interpretations find it probable that these features were primarily used in species identification, courtship, and dominance display, much like the antlers and horns of modern ungulates.Triceratops was traditionally placed within the "short-frilled" ceratopsids, but modern cladistic studies show it to be a member of Chasmosaurinae, which usually have long frills. Two species, T. horridus and T. prorsus, are considered valid today. Seventeen different species, however, have been named throughout history. Research published in 2010 concluded that the contemporaneous Torosaurus, a ceratopsid long regarded as a separate genus, represents Triceratops in its mature form. This view has still been highly disputed and much more data is needed to settle this ongoing debate.Triceratops has been documented by numerous remains collected since the genus was first described in 1889 by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh. Specimens representing life stages from hatchling to adult have been found. As the archetypal ceratopsian, Triceratops is one of the most beloved, popular dinosaurs and has been featured in numerous films, postage stamps, and many other types of media.</p>
<h2 ALIGN="center">GIGANOTOSAURUS</H2>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="file:///C:/Users/Lenovo/OneDrive/%E7%94%BB%E5%83%8F/Screenshots/Screenshot%202024-06-21%20222429.png" WIDTH="957" HEIGHT="366"></IMG></CENTER><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Giganotosaurus is a species of very large theropod dinosaur in the family Carcharodontosauridae, within the allosauroid superfamily. It specifically belongs to the tribe Giganotosaurini, along with the other South American carcharodontosaurs. The type species, Giganotosaurus carolinii, originally lived between 99.6 and 95 million years ago during the Cenomanian age of the late Cretaceous period. Fossilized remains are found in the Candeleros Formation, located in the Neuquén province of Argentina. A fictitious species featured in the Jurassic film franchise is depicted living farther north, possibly in southern North America, at the very end of the Maastrichtian age closer to 66 million years ago; the fictional creature is not given a species name, but Jurassic-Pedia refers to it as Giganotosaurus “ultimus” for the sake of convenience. Its genus name means “giant southern reptile,” referencing its immense size and habitat in South America, while the species name of the real animal honors Rubén D. Carolini, who discovered the first known fossils. The fictional creature’s fan-made species name means “final,” referencing its tenure at the tail end of the Mesozoic era, just before a cataclysmic extinction event wiped its kind from the face of the Earth.Carolini, its discoverer, was an amateur fossil hunter in 1993 when driving a dune buggy through badlands near the Patagonian village of Villa El Chocón. The animal’s tibia was discovered, and paleontologists were dispatched from the National University of Comahue to recover it for study. At the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology conference in 1994, the discovery was announced by paleontologists Rodolfo Aníbal Coria and Leonardo Salgado, and the announcement caught the attention of American science writer “Dino” Don Lessem. He offered to fund further expeditions to seek out more remains of this mysterious giant theropod of Patagonia. Subsequent research discovered the animal’s skull (heavily damaged and spread out across the area), most of its vertebral column, bones from its pectoral and pelvic girdles, its femora, and the tibia and fibula of its left leg. All together, seventy percent of the dinosaur’s skeleton was recovered, despite its fossilized bones being scattered around the badlands. Well before the remains were assembled it was already clear that this animal was one of the biggest theropods ever discovered, and it was given its name: Giganotosaurus carolinii. Its discoverer Carolini requested that the fossil be put on display at the Ernesto Bachmann Paleontological Museum in the village near where it was found; the museum was inaugurated in 1995 and the fossil was given a centerpiece exhibit, showing it still partly in the ground and surrounded by tools used to excavate its impressive remains.The size of Giganotosaurus was debated upon its discovery, with some scientists believing it to be the largest theropod known at least in the Southern Hemisphere. Since its skeleton had been found disarticulated and incomplete, as are most fossils, its exact size was unclear. For ninety years Tyrannosaurus rex had been the largest known theropod dinosaur, but the femur of Giganotosaurus was slightly longer at 4.7 feet, hinting that this newfound creature might have been bigger still. Coria and Saldago estimated its skull to be five feet in length, and found that its bones were proportionally more robust, suggesting that it was heavier than a tyrannosaur of similar size. 1996 saw the illumination of its poorly-known close relative, Carcharodontosaurus, which inhabited Africa; now the evolutionary relations of both animals were better understood, as were their general proportions and anatomy. While the title of largest theropod was and still is hotly debated, it is unquestionable that Giganotosaurus and its kin were titans of their world.Fairly few fossils of this giant carnivore have been found since its initial discovery. The left part of a lower jaw, described in 1998 by Coria and his colleague Jorge Orlando Calvo, was identified as belonging to a Giganotosaurus; it had been found originally by Calvo in 1988, but went unidentified for a decade. While incomplete, this jaw bone was even larger than that of the first named specimen, suggesting an animal with a skull 6.4 feet in length. A partial tooth, originally found in 1987 but not identified until 1999, was also linked with Giganotosaurus, and a fossilized trackway was suggested by Calvo to have been made by this theropod too.With so few fossils known it is hard to say how big the animal originally grew, but many scientists suspect that Giganotosaurus could have been the largest theropod to have ever lived. Tyrannosaurus was similar in size, but may not have been as heavy, and Spinosaurus was probably longer but certainly more lightweight. A variety of other carcharodontosaurids, too, have contended for this spot; many close relatives of Giganotosaurus are similarly colossal. The only individuals whose size can be measured with any certainty are those which are de-extinct. While DNA from this animal was recovered by International Genetic Technologies sometime before 2009, the dinosaur itself was not cloned; its genetic material was used in hybridization projects by InGen, bringing certain aspects of its genome back to life. It was not until after 2018 that a living Giganotosaurus was cloned by the biotech giant Biosyn Genetics. At least one animal, a male, was bred in Biosyn Genetics Sanctuary, where it reigned as apex predator for some time; this animal grew to exceed fifty feet in length. However, the animal cloned was not Giganotosaurus carolinii, but rather a then-unknown species which lived closer to the end of the Cretaceous and ranged farther north. It is, therefore, the last known surviving carcharodontosaurid prior to the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction. This specimen died in the 2022 Biosyn Valley incident, potentially bringing its species back to extinction.</p>

Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is Greek for "arm lizard", in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means "deep chest". Brachiosaurus is estimated to have been between 18 and 22 meters (59 and 72 ft) long; body mass estimates of the subadult holotype specimen range from 28.3 to 46.9 metric tons (31.2 to 51.7 short tons). It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods. Atypically, Brachiosaurus had longer forelimbs than hindlimbs, which resulted in a steeply inclined trunk, and a proportionally shorter tail.Brachiosaurus is the namesake genus of the family Brachiosauridae, which includes a handful of other similar sauropods. Most popular depictions of Brachiosaurus are in fact based on Giraffatitan, a genus of brachiosaurid dinosaur from the Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania. Giraffatitan was originally described by German paleontologist Werner Janensch in 1914 as a species of Brachiosaurus, B. brancai, but moved to its own genus in 2009. Three other species of Brachiosaurus have been named based on fossils found in Africa and Europe; two are no longer considered valid, and a third has become a separate genus, Lusotitan.The type specimen of B. altithorax is still the most complete specimen, and only a few other specimens are thought to belong to the genus, making it one of the rarer sauropods of the Morrison Formation. It is regarded as a high browser, possibly cropping or nipping vegetation as high as 9 meters (30 ft) off the ground. Unlike other sauropods, it was unsuited for rearing on its hindlimbs. It has been used as an example of a dinosaur that was most likely ectothermic because of its large size and the corresponding need for sufficient forage, but more recent research suggests it was warm-blooded. Among the most iconic and initially thought to be one of the largest dinosaurs, Brachiosaurus has appeared in popular culture, notably in the 1993 film Jurassic park.</p>
